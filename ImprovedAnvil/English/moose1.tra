@4200 = ~I greet you, nature's true friend!~
@4201 = ~My mission is to give you some important information and ask you to hurry to find the Grand Druid.~
@4202 = ~Yes, tell me where I can find the Grand Druid.~
@4203 = ~Go on.~
@4204 = ~The mirror in this area has changed to a magical portal. If you had a paticular sigil, the portal could send you to a wilderness where you would be able to find the Grand Druid.~
@4205 = ~Without the sigil, the portal will send you into the lair of a most horrible beast.~
@4206 = ~A beast?~
@4207 = ~It's not even a beast. It rather resembles a beast. It's a foul unnatural creature.~
@4208 = ~It is probably the sigil's guardian, but I don't know how you are going to defeat such a creature. It's incredibly powerful, but it must have weaknesses too.~
@4209 = ~Kill the creature and use the sigil on the portal. That's all I can tell you, nature's friend.~
