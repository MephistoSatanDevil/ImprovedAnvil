@3201 = ~Daystar sword is a potential danger and should be destroyed without delay. Hand it over to me and I will let you go.~
@3202 = ~Very well, take it and be gone. I'm not looking for trouble.~
@3203 = ~I won't give you anything. You made a bad mistake by showing yourself to me. It's the time for your kind to learn one or two lessons.~
@3204 = ~That's a wise decision.~
@3205 = ~I see that you don't want to stay alive. I admit that it's much better to finish it in this way. I will destroy the sword and its holder together.~
@3206 = ~I won't give you anything. I am a necromancer and I know how to deal with you and your minions. It's the time for you to learn one or two lessons.~
@3207 = ~If you are a necromancer, this is no longer a conflict over the sword. I know why you are here and I will fight with all of my power and resources. Prepare to die, mortal!~
