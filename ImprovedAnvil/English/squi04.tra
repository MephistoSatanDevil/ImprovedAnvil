@4470 = ~I thank you once again for those hazelnuts.~
@4471 = ~Greetings again, my <LADYLORD>!~
@4472 = ~I am an old squirrel and I feel that I won't live for long. Since you were so nice to me and my nephews, I want to share an old secret with you.~
@4473 = ~A long time ago, when I was quite young, I was sitting up on a branch of an oak tree when I noticed a human burying something nearby. It was a strange stone. He never saw me watching him. He finished burying it and left; I was curious so I dug it up. I'm not sure what it is, but from the way that the man was acting it seemed to be very valuable.~
@4474 = ~It's my sole legacy and the only thing I have in the world. I want to give it to you, my friend.~
@4475 = ~I hope that you are able to discover the stone's purpose, and why it's so important. I have lived nearly my whole life thinking that the stone is something very special. Of course, I've also feared that it is nothing more than a stone; I certainly hope it doesn't turn out to be worthless for you or a waste of your time.~
@4476 = ~I assure you that it's most valuable for me. Its main value lies in the fact that it's ALL that you have and you generously decided to give it to me.~
@4477 = ~So do I!~
@4478 = ~Take it, my friend. I don't think that we will meet each other again.~
