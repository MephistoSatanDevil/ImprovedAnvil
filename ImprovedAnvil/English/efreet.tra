@2550 = ~You have an efreeti bottle among your items which doesn't naturally belong to you.~
@2551 = ~The efreeti trapped inside the bottle should be freed. Hand the bottle over to me and we will leave each other peacefully.~
@2552 = ~The bottle had been here for a long time. Why didn't you just come and pick it before?~
@2553 = ~Unfortunately, I don't have the habbit of listening to threats. Either go or do whatever you are supposed to do. I'm not going to give it to you.~
@2554 = ~A fair question with an easy answer! I was tuned to sense the bottle only when it was in the possession of a living creature.~
@2555 = ~Now, will give it to me or shall we talk with each other in a different language?~
@2556 = ~Ok, take it and be gone.~
@2557 = ~Let's try the other language.~
@2558 = ~Thank you.~
@2559 = ~You made a grave mistake.~
