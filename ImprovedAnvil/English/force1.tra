@4750 = ~I'm very glad to see the planar sphere in this plane again. You have obviously come here to be slain by me and to leave the sphere for me.~
@4751 = ~On the contrary! I have come here to put an end to your existence.~
@4752 = ~No, I'm here to seek Lavok's revenge. It was his last wish and request.~
@4753 = ~I was not talking about your reasons for being here; I was rather telling you the consequence of your coming. You will be dead and the sphere will be mine.~
@4754 = ~Let's open the game with a warm-up!~
@4755 = ~How was that? I know, I know. You are much stronger than being afraid of such creatures. Let's see what you will do in the second round.~
@4756 = ~Now, we are going to start some real challenge if you don't mind.~
@4757 = ~Hmm, that was impressive. Let's see what you will do against the grandlords.~
@4758 = ~You shouldn't have tried to rest in the middle of our little game. Why don't you play fair?~
@4759 = ~I'm sure you won't mind if I do something in return.~
