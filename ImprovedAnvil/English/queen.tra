@1050 = ~You killed one of our best servants and took the black spider figurine. Hand it over immediately if you don't want to be punished.~
@1051 = ~The last think I can think of is to be robbed by a spider. Let's see how you will punish me.~
@1052 = ~Your timing was terrible. I'm not looking for another battle at this moment. Very well take the figurine and be gone.~
@1053 = ~You are an intelligent creature of your kind. How is it possible for a spider to speak?~
@1054 = ~Come then, pathetic <PRO_RACE>! You will die for your arrogant words.~
@1055 = ~Good!~
@1056 = ~You can't understand what is above your head, mortal! Will you give me the figurine or not?~
@1057 = ~I don't have the figurine anymore. I may have sold or lost it; it wasn't an important item.~
