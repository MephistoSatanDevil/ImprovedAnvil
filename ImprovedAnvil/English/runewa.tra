@2900 = ~What? It seems that we have unexpected visitors here.~
@2901 = ~You there! What do you want in this place?~
@2902 = ~I'm here to put an end to your new stronghold, assassin!~
@2903 = ~Shut up and listen to me, pathetic creature! If you tell me the exact numbers and locations of assassins inside the stronghold, I may let you live.~
@2904 = ~I wonder how on earth you know about the new stronghold. I should go inside and warn everyone. Follow me if you have the guts.~
@2905 = ~Although I have no idea how you have learned about the new stronghold here, I'm pretty sure that you will not leave this place alive if you enter the stronghold. I should now go inside and inform everyone that we have visitors.~
