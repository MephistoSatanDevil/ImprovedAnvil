============
I- Copyright:
============

Even though the fan-made modules and materials we release are not subject to 'legal' copyright, the standards of moral
courtesy are still applicable to them.

Improved Anvil is not a public property. If any fellow mod-maker wants to borrow any idea from Improved Anvil to use in his
own mod or to make a separate and new mod, I expect him/her to contact with me and ask for my permission. Once the permission
is granted, I will also expect him/her to add a note to his/her mod's credentials to let everyone know that the idea has been
borrowed from me and Improved Anvil.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

Currently the Gibberlings 3 site is disgracefully hosting a mod which is made by directly stealing one of my ideas (the idea
of randomizing items via scripts) which was used in Imprvoved Anvil for the first time. The thievery has happened without
sending any permission request to me and without even mentioning my name in the mod's credentials.

Many other individual fixes and tweaks are also silently copied from Improved Anvil and used in other mods without my
permission and without mentioning my name in those mods'documents and credentials.

I'm sure that players who follow moral standards in their lives will never install and use such stolen materials. Sites which
accept to host stolen mods only ruin their own reputation.

================
II- Terms of Use:
================

We expect players who download and install Improved Anvil to agree with the following terms of use:

1- Improved Anvil is not a public property. I agree to use this mod without modifying, hacking, or editing its content.

2- I agree that I will not share the mod with anyone else and will keep it only for my own personal use.

3- I agree to follow the mod's installation instructions accurately.

4- I agree to play Improved Anvil the way it is intended to be played without cheating during the game.

5- If I violate any of the abovementioned terms, I will not receive any technical support from the mod's developers and will
   not send any false and misleading reports to the mod's forum about problems I have created in my own game.
