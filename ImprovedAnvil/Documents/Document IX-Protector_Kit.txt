                            Protector Kit Description


PROTECTOR: Protectors are dedicated defenders of people and nature. They usually take residence
close to people who are in need of help, but they are also always prepared to travel when the
cause is fighting evil. While being great warriors, they can also learn and cast more spells than
other rangers. Protectors have such a strong affinity with mother nature that they never wear
armors greater than the studded leather. This self-imposed limitation has been compensated with
mental and physical abilities. A protector sacrifices a portion of his own health and stamina to
start learning the special protective methods and abilities of his kit.

Racial Combat:

Once per day, the protector can use this powerful innate ability to be prepared for fighting a
special race of his or her choice. The ability will grant useful bonuses against enemies of the
