        ************************************************************************
                          Installation & Compatibility issues
        ************************************************************************

===================
Pre-installation:
===================
Before installing Improved Anvil, make sure that you have installed the game in the following
order:

1- BG2
2- TOB
3- TOB Official patch
4- Baldurdash TOB fixpack-1.12 (Non-weidu version)

Alternatively, make sure that you have BG2:EE with the latest patch installed.

Note(1): All of the changes Improved Anvil applies to the game are based on the assumption that
         the player HAS installed Baldurdash TOB fixpack v1.12. So, please do not forget to
         install it and do not replace it with any other fixpack if you play the vanilla BG2 ToB.

Note(2): Don't install Baldurdash's game text update.

Note(3): Players who don't have Baldurdash TOB fixpack can downloaded it from the following
         webpage:
         http://www.baldurdash.org/ToB/Fixes/TOBfixes.html
         It's the first one in the list. Only install that one and forgo others.
         Alternatively, you can also take it from this page as well:
         http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showtopic=3853

Note(4): If you start the game in multi-player mode to create custom NPcs, after the game starts, save it and quit;
         then go to your main BG2 folder and cut the saved game from the mpsave folder,
         and paste it in "save" folder;
         then load the saved game in single player mode.

Note(5): Do not import characters from BG1 or vanilla BG2.
         This concerns not only the primary character (the protagonist),
         but other party members as well, in case you decided to play with more than one custom NPC.
         Importing a character might prevent you from seeing all the new content, quests and items alike.

============================================================================
Recommended and Ease of Use components to be installed before Improved Anvil:
============================================================================
"Ease of use" (install right after Baldurdash fixpack):
        - Infinite Weapon, Potion and Ring/Amulet Stacking for SOA and TOB (Recommended)
        - Shut Up "You Must Gather Your Party Before Venturing Forth (optional)

        - Imoen ToB Dialogue Fix (Recommended)

Note 1: Use the original "Ease of Use" mod (rather than the BG2 Tweakpack).
Note 2: Don't install any other component of Ease-of-Use except the mentioned ones. You can
        of course choose not to install some or all of the recommended and optional components
        mentioned above, But do not install any other components which are not in the list.
Note 3: All recommendations regarding the Ease of Use components apply for BG2EE, as well.

================================
The summary of pre-installation:
================================
1- either, BG2 + ToB + TOB Official patch + Baldurdash TOB fixpack-1.12
   or, BG2EE + latest official patch
2- Selected components of Ease of use (optional)

OPTIONAL:3- Any other mods, provided that they are NOT in the list of incompatible mods below and
            provided that they will NOT require you to install them after Improved Anvil.

Now, you are ready to install Improved Anvil.

=====================
Order of Installation:
=====================

             ************************************************************
             *** Install Improved Anvil AFTER all of your other mods. ***
             ************************************************************

Notes:

  (1) You need to start a new game (even if you were already playing a previous version).
  (2) If you accidentally install a mod after Improved Anvil, you will need to amend the order
      of installation. To do this, uninstall Improved Anvil and then install it again. Hitting
      the RE-install option will not do. You will need to uninstall Improved Anvil completely
      and install it afresh to make sure that it is installed after all other mods.
  (3) If any other mod also requires to be installed "after" all other mods, just skip it and do
      NOT install it with/after/before Improved Anvil.

==============================================================
List of mods which should NOT be installed with Improved Anvil:
==============================================================

Improved Anvil is compatible with the majority of other mods, however, there are a few mods (or
mod-components) which should not be installed with Improved Anvil if you want to have a bugfree
game (some of them are technically incompatible with Improved Anvil, some others are conceptually
problematic and some others are bugged regardless of their compatibility with Improved Anvil).
Also, for any given mod, if more than 50% of the mod's content is known to be incompatible with
Improved Anvil (while the other 50% is untested or dubious), the entire mod is listed as
incompatible for more safety).

This is the list of the known mods and/or mod-components which should not be installed if you
intend to install and play Improved Anvil:

1- Item Upgrade
2- Spell50
3- Ascension
4- Tactics (and any other mod which adds tactical challenges to the game)
5- Improved Battles
6- Big picture
7- SCS II
8- NEJ2
9- Rogue Rebalancing
10- Solaufein NPC
11- Divine Remix
12- Oversight (and any other mod which tampers with creatures' alignments)
13- G3's BG2 Fixpack
14- G3's BG2 Tweakpack
15- D0-Tweakpack
16- The Bigg Tweaks
19- Unfinished Business
20- Quest Pack
21- Ashes of Ember
22- PS-tele and/or any other mod which adds teleportation ability to the party
23- Ruad (and any other itempack with powerful items)
24- Refinements (and any other mod which adds new HLAs or adds resistance to physical damage to
                 armors)
25- Any mod which adds new bardsongs or new types of traps (or modifies the existent ones)
26- Any spellpack which modifies the game's existing spells or adds new spells to the game if
    those new spells are available to players (this includes any kit-mod which adds spells or
    spell-like abilities).
27- Sword and Fist
28- Planar Sphere mod
29- All components of Ease-Of-Use except those listed as recommended (or optional) above.

Note(1): It's also recommended not to install "Saerileth NPC" & "Valen NPC" with Improved Anvil.
Note(2): Dungeon-be-gone (version 1.4) is compatible with Improved Anvil; however, Improved Anvil's
         "Item Randomizer" program initiates in that area at the beginning of the game and it takes
         a few seconds before it can fully initiate. On slower computers it may take about 40
         seconds (after the initial auto-save), on faster computers, it can be done faster. The
         point is that you should not rush to talk to that fellow and leave the area too quickly.
         You don't need to do anything special, just stay in the area long enough to see the
         message "Item Randomizer successfully initiated" and then you can leave the dungeon
         without any problem. Don't use any other version of Dungeon-be-gone. Only v1.4 is recommended.
Note(3): "The Four" version 3 (and newer) is compatible with Improved Anvil and is the *only* mod
         which can be installed *after* Improved Anvil. Older versions of "The Four" are
         incompatible.
Note(4): In addition to those particular tweakpacks which are listed as strictly incompatible, it
         is also strongly recommended that you do NOT install any other tweakpack.
Note(5): The standalone versions of Auramaster druid kit and Riskbreaker kit are not supported
         any longer. The newest versions of these kits already exist in Improved Anvil. You should
         not install the outdated standalone versions of these kits.
Note(6): Tower of Deception mod "upto version 3.2" is compatible with IA. Do not use any newer versions
         of that mod with Improved Anvil
==========================
Upgrading to version 6:
==========================

If you already have a previous version of Improved Anvil, you can easily update the mod to the
new version as instructed below:

1- Uninstall the old version of Improved Anvil
2- Uninstall all of the (listed) incompatible mods/components if you have any of them installed.
3- Delete the "ImprovedAnvil" folder from your main BG2 folder.
4- Unzip the new version of the mod in your BG2 folder. If asked whether you want to replace
   anything, reply "yes". Now, you should have a new "ImprovedAnvil" folder in your BG2 folder.
5- Install the new version of the mod.
6- Starting a new game is mandatory (even if you were already playing a previous version).

Have fun!
