            <h4>Introduction for the new players</h4>

            <p>Improved Anvil started out as an item upgrade mod. Later on, it evolved into a tactical mod, featuring lots of difficult, hand-crafted fights. Eventually, it become more of a total conversion mod. While you still play the same game story-wise, the ruleset, in-game balance, AI behaviour and lots of other things are modified in order to facilitate IA's overall increased difficulty of gameplay.</p>

            <p>IA is not a mod for those who prefer to rush around, destroying everything in their path. IA won't let you do this (unless you cheat). Even if you cheat, you might have problems doing so. Be prepared for a slow and thoughtful pace, make sure that you turn on the autopause features and start exploring the game.</p>

            <p>If you consider yourself an experienced player, skip this section and dive straight into the game. Otherwise, I recommend that you keep
reading and familiarizing yourself with key features and changes that IA applies to your game.</p>

            <p>Improved Anvil has been known to spawn lots of controversy in the past due to people having different expectations. If you realize that this isn't something you were expecting, maybe it would be better to postpone or abandon the idea of playing the mod. I will try to provide you with an honest view of what IA can and can't do from perspective of a person who's been involved in playing, testing and developing the mod for a few years. </p>

            <h4>Cheating &amp; cheesy behaviour</h4>

            <p>IA is a mod that actively enforces and encourages honest behaviour, both by player and the AI. One of the core design principles consists in removal of potentially abusive and dishonest methods of playing against which the computer is helpless. The more obvious examples of such abuse include application of ultra-powerful items, running around while shooting at the enemy and so on (everything that falls under the broad category of so-called 'cheesy' behaviour). While it is not possible to completely eradicate all such possibilities (terrain abuse would be a glaring example), IA does its best to do so.</p>

            <p>Enemies in IA are improved considerably. They possess immunities and increased resistances to things they've never had in vanilla game. Even the smartest enemy will not survive more then a round or two against a high-level party equipped with powerful magic and enchanted weapons. Enemies need endurance to survive. IA gives them said endurance. This is never done blindly or without consideration for consequences. There are always vulnerabilities to exploit and tactics to apply in order to take the enemy down. They just aren't what you might have been accustomed to in vanilla game.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, enemies have abilities that a player's party will never receive. This is OK. Your party will have plenty of their own unique items, abilities and spells to choose from. The enemies will never, however, do something illegal, like targeting invisible party members directly, in order to win. Their AI strives to be honest and not overstep the limits of what a real human player can do. There might be exceptions in cases of especially powerful and might opponents. You don't expect an ancient dragon to be a pushover, do you?</p>

            <p>Does the mod bend the rules sometimes to provide a tough challenge? Yes, it does. IA has always been about hand-crafted, unique experiences. IA is a successor of Weimer's Tactics in that sense, but with no cheese.</p>

            <p>Does IA provide a player with the possibility to pick and choose which component work for him and which doesn't? No, it is not and never will. IA is not about moderation and configuration. Does the mod favor certain things and disregard the others? Yes, it does. IA is a vision of its authors, it was never intended to appeal to each and everyone's sense of what is right and wrong in the game. The tactics you might consider normal and even logical in vanilla game might not be applicable in IA. You have to accept that.</p>
