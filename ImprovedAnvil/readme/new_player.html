            <h4>Introduction for the new players</h4>

            <p>Improved Anvil started out as an item upgrade mod. Later on, it evolved into a tactical mod, featuring lots of difficult, hand-crafted fights. Eventually, it become more of a total conversion mod. While you still play the same game story-wise, the ruleset, in-game balance, AI behaviour and lots of other things are modified in order to facilitate IA's overall increased difficulty of gameplay.</p>

            <p>IA is not a mod for those who prefer to rush around, destroying everything in their path. IA won't let you do this (unless you cheat). Even if you cheat, you might have problems doing so. Be prepared for a slow and thoughtful pace, make sure that you turn on the autopause features and start exploring the game.</p>

            <p>If you consider yourself an experienced player, skip this section and dive straight into the game. Otherwise, I recommend that you keep
reading and familiarizing yourself with key features and changes that IA applies to your game.</p>

            <p>Improved Anvil has been known to spawn lots of controversy in the past due to people having different expectations. If you realize that this isn't something you were expecting, maybe it would be better to postpone or abandon the idea of playing the mod. I will try to provide you with an honest view of what IA can and can't do from perspective of a person who's been involved in playing, testing and developing the mod for a few years. </p>

    <div class="toggle">
        <h4 class="title">Cheating &amp; cheesy behaviour</h4>
        <div class="togglebox">
            <div>

            <p>IA is a mod that actively enforces and encourages honest behaviour, both by player and the AI. One of the core design principles consists in removal of potentially abusive and dishonest methods of playing against which the computer is helpless. The more obvious examples of such abuse include application of ultra-powerful items, running around while shooting at the enemy and so on (everything that falls under the broad category of so-called 'cheesy' behaviour). While it is not possible to completely eradicate all such possibilities (terrain abuse would be a glaring example), IA does its best to do so.</p>

            <p>Enemies in IA are improved considerably. They possess immunities and increased resistances to things they've never had in vanilla game. Even the smartest enemy will not survive more then a round or two against a high-level party equipped with powerful magic and enchanted weapons. Enemies need endurance to survive. IA gives them said endurance. This is never done blindly or without consideration for consequences. There are always vulnerabilities to exploit and tactics to apply in order to take the enemy down. They just aren't what you might have been accustomed to in vanilla game.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, enemies have abilities that a player's party will never receive. This is OK. Your party will have plenty of their own unique items, abilities and spells to choose from. The enemies will never, however, do something illegal, like targeting invisible party members directly, in order to win. Their AI strives to be honest and not overstep the limits of what a real human player can do. There might be exceptions in cases of especially powerful and might opponents. You don't expect an ancient dragon to be a pushover, do you?</p>

            <p>Does the mod bend the rules sometimes to provide a tough challenge? Yes, it does. IA has always been about hand-crafted, unique experiences. IA is a successor of Weimer's Tactics in that sense, but with no cheese.</p>

            <p>Does IA provide a player with the possibility to pick and choose which component work for him and which doesn't? No, it is not and never will. IA is not about moderation and configuration. Does the mod favor certain things and disregard the others? Yes, it does. IA is a vision of its authors, it was never intended to appeal to each and everyone's sense of what is right and wrong in the game. The tactics you might consider normal and even logical in vanilla game might not be applicable in IA. You have to accept that.</p>

        <h4 class="title">Code of conduct</h4>
        <div class="togglebox">
            <div>

            <p>This is an approximate list of cheats and cheap tactics that one should avoid if he really wants to enjoy IA. These are the rules that IA testers followed and still follow strictly when we design combat encounters. These are exploits that you might attempt in a strange desire to cheat the mod and break the game. The mod will resist, however, and the majority of what's written below has been prevented in one way or another. You can still undo any change, of course, but this is not something we would endorse.</p>

            <p>Plain cheats that no self-respecting player would ever employ:
                <ul>
                    <li>using CluaConsole</li>
                    <li>using game editors</li>
                    <li>using hot key commands (Ctrl+R, etc.)</li>
                    <li>deleting files from the override folder</li>
                    <li>using xp/gold/item exploits</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Cheesy and questionable tactics (your mileage may vary, but testers never use those):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>hit &amp; run tactics</li>
                    <li>resting when the enemy is coming at you to expire his protections</li>
                    <li>stealing critical and quest-related items from enemies before they turn hostile</li>
                    <li>killing an enemy before he turns hostile and starts to fight</li>
                    <li>taking personal items of joinable NPCs and using them with another party member</li>
                    <li>passing around items during the battle just in time to prevent certain bad effects from happening (e.g., equipping all items that improve saving throws when a Finger of Death is already flying at your mage)</li>
                    <li>applying consumables such as potions when a negative effect already hits you in waves (e.g., using potion that increases magic resistance when an enemy has already hit you with ADHW)</li>
                    <li>re-casting spell protections endlessly to force enemy casters to waste their spells and casting rounds (a human player would've changed tactics whereas the AI has its limitations; we try to overcome those but there's a limit to what one can achieve with IE scripts)</li>
                    <li>abusing the area structure to prevent enemies from acting efficiently</li>
                    <li>leaving the area in the middle of the battle</li>
                    <li>casting hostile spells from offscreen</li>
                    <li>hide &amp; wait</li>
                    <li>erasing known spells from the spell book to write and learn them afresh (via Wondrous Recall or Wish)</li>
                    <li>refreshing contingencies and triggers in the middle of the battle</li>
                    <li>lowering the game difficulty to get maximum HP rolls (this is controversial and very individual; it is a personal prefence of mine and Sikret's, though)</li>
                    <li>lowerint the game difficulty at certain points of the battle (playing on easy or normal if you are a new player or just prefer an easier game is OK; lowering it for a round or two just when you have to make a tough saving throw is cheesy)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>IA is most fun and rewarding when you fight bravely, honourably and stand up to enemies. It might appear strange, counterintuitive and illogical when the usual guerilla tactics (hit &amp; run, throwing deadly clouds from off screen, etc.) tend to work much better. Unfortunately, we cannot design an AI that works efficiently in a similar manner. Instead, IA encourages you to get into the enemies' faces - something that we find to be most appropriate for an epic fantasy game.</p>

        <h4 class="title">Party composition</h4>
        <div class="togglebox">
            <div>

            <p>I have an admission to make: IA is not a finished mod. We have applied many changes to enemies, scripts, spells and changed the balance drastically. One could always be expected to win the vanilla game even with the most inefficient party composition. This won't work in IA. You have to be a bit of a power gamer and be at peace with the fact that we've improved many classes and kits but nerfed the others in order to encourage a specific playing style. We have many plans for further improvement of those classes and extra content related to them. But this is work in progress.</p>

            <p>What follows is the most honest depiction of how powerful or not are specific classes and kits in the game. This is done, once again, in order to prevent any confusion or misplaced expectations. Read on and decide for yourself. For those who are unsure, we will provide some advice on party composition as well.</p>

            <b>Fighters</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Berserker, Kensai, Barbarian &mdash; all decent choices, you can never go wrong with a pure fighter in Improved Anvil;</li>
                <li>Riskbreaker (custom IA kit) &mdash; this kit was designed to be the most powerful fighter kit and it truly is, only kensai can come close in terms of damage output;</li>
                <li>Dwarven Defender (new EE kit) &mdash; solid tank, with huge potential for reaching low Armor Class and high physical resistances;</li>
                <li>Champion of Arvoreen (custom IA kit) &mdash; a cross between fighter and paladin, designed specifically for Mazzy Fentan, works best with her in party;</li>
                <li>Wizard Slayer &mdash; it has always been weird even in vanilla game, poor choice for unexperienced players in IA;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Rangers</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Vagrant (custom IA kit) &mdash; very strong, best works for the protagonist character, has access to several brand-new quests;</li>
                <li>Protector (custom IA kit) &mdash; another great choice, designed specifically for Valygar, highly recommended for beginner players;</li>
                <li>Stalker, Beast Master &mdash; decent choices, especially Stalker, but not as efficient as the IA kits;</li>
                <li>Archer &mdash; don't bother until the upcoming IAv7 shows up, ranged weapons are nerfed significantly, you will not enjoy it;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Paladins</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><i>all paladin kits are strong choices because they are warriors. However, IA has a new tactical feature that allows evil enemy clerics to turn good-aligned paladins &mdash; it requires a certain degree of skill from player to play the class efficiently, so make decisions based on your skills;</i></li>
                <li>Undead Hunter &mdash; best choice #1: undeads are truly scary in IA, having a warrior with permanent protection from Level Drain is an asset;</li>
                <li>Inquisitor &mdash; best choice #2: even though we have nerfed this kit's Dispel Magic significantly, it is still a strong weapon in hands of a skilled player;</li>
                <li>Cavalier &mdash; decent choice with extra slaying power against demons, but not as expressive in his abilities as the two kits above;</li>
                <li>Blackguard (new EE kit) &mdash; IA was never designed with an evil party in mind, the kit is not fully tested, so play at your own risk, be it a custom character or the new NPC, Dorn;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Monks</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>all monks are powerful, as of IAv62;</li>
                <li>they might require a bit more skill from player in the early stages, but they will turn deadly as the game progresses;</li>
                <li>two new kits that were introduced by the EE (the Sun Soul monk and Dark Moon monk) are almost identical in their powers to the main class;</li>
                <li>whatever special abilities those kits possess are there mostly for flavour &mdash; do not expect them to be of good use in IA's improved encounters;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Clerics</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>all clerics are generally a decent choice for your party &mdash; they have spells that are necessary for your party's survival;</li>
                <li>as the game progresses, however, you will note that pure clerics do not contribute as much to the game as they did earlier &mdash; an unfortunate side effect of not having enough time to add powerful features that are consistent with IA's gameplay;</li>
                <li>you will not suffer with a pure cleric in your party, but you'll have a much easier time with some sort of multi- or dual-class in their place;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Druids</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Auramaster (custom IA kit) &mdash; this druid kit has all the right spells to be effective in IA, it is a powerful addition to the party;</li>
                <li>Avenger &mdash; this kit was completely redesigned for the upcoming 7th version of the mod and it is now a powerful, melee-oriented druid;</li>
                <li>Shapeshifter, Totemic Druid &mdash; these kits are uniproved and therefore not recommended for IA;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Mages</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><i>mages are bread and butter of IA, any decent party needs at least two if it is to stand a chance at winning the game;</i></li>
                <li>Necromancer &mdash; best choice for protagonist, satisfying playing experience and lots of new content to explore;</li>
                <li>Sorcerer &mdash; second-best choice, for their instant access to many rare spells;
                <li>specialist mages &mdash; not as good as Necromancer, require more experience to play, but good picks nonetheless;</li>
                <li>Red Dragon Disciple &mdash; not recommended for unskilled player; the gains are doubtful and the penalties are significant;</li>

            </ul>

            <b>Rogues</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><i>rogues is one of those classes that has been punished the most by the IA &mdash; a sad fact that requires additional intervention; the changes will come, eventually, but for now this is not a good option, unless you are very experienced;</i></li>
                <li>Swashbuckler &mdash; this class is the closest a rogue can get to a warrior in terms of efficiency and damage output; if you want to have a thief in your party, go with the swashbuckler, he'll be able to pull his weight, with a bit nurturing in the beginning;</li>
                <li>Blade &mdash; this kit was incredibly powerful in IAv5, and probably is the one to blame for a significant toning down of all the rogue classes; you can still play it with some degree of efficiency, but it won't be a walk in the park;</i></li>
                <li>the rest of the rogue kits might have an occasional moment of glory in the world of IA, but those moments are limited, so if you decide to bring one into your party, do it at your own peril;</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Multi-classes</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><i>another category of playable characters that has gone under the knife after the glorious debut in IAv5 &mdash; a playable option, overall, but requires skill and patience;</i></li>
                <li>Fighter/Cleric, Cleric/Ranger, Fighter/Druid &mdash; the warrior/priest multi-classes are the most potent ones; while they will still suffer from slower experience progression and delayed HLAs, they can stand their ground as tanks and dish out plenty of damage with the right buffs;</li>
                <li>Fighter/Mage, Fighter/Illusionist &mdash; these classes have been incredibly efficient in the earlier versions of the mod due to their access to illusionary buffs; in IAv6, illusions does not provide as many benefits as before, thus decreasing the potential of such character in the party;</li>
                <li>rogue multi-classes &mdash; not recommended, the rogue part of class will not bring anything to the game and slow down the progression in the second class; you'd be better off picking a single class character (Fighter, Cleric or Mage);</li>
                <li>Cleric/Mage &mdash; a curious option for more experienced players; you will suffer, however, from lack of spell slots and delayed access to HLA tables, not recommended for a first play-through;</li>
                <li>triple multi-classes &mdash; unfortunately, they develop too slowly in each class to be efficient, not recommended;</li>
            </ul>
