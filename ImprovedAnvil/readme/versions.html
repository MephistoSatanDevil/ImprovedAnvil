            <h4>Version history</h4>

            <h5>Version 6.4</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>WeiDU compiler is updated to version 246.</li>
                <li>The mod has been updated to be fully compatible with BG2:EE v2.5.</li>
                <li>Historically, the vanilla game has never allowed to have +X vs. monster type enchantments functioning properly on weapons. With the new opcode from EE this has now been fixed and all weapons with this effect are functioning as intended.</li>
                <li>The Squirreled Away quest has been made available to all protagonists.</li>
                <li>The Four, a separate mod made some time ago by Sikret, has been integrated as an optional component.</li>
                <li>All class/character restrictions for crafted items are all reworked with the help of 319 opcode (this has allowed to remove a lot of clutter from the global baldur.bcs script).</li>
                <li>Players now can level up Neera & Imoen manually and select whatever spells they desire.</li>
                <li>Brain Golem and Hardwood Golem now sport brand new distinctive colours.</li>
                <li>A script for automatic & precise XP adjustment of joinable NPCs is implemented.</li>
                <li>Allow neutrally-aligned protagonists to encounter lady Vanya.</li>
                <li>Numerous bugfixes and small improvements discovered during playtesting of IA v6.3 are introduced.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Version 6.3</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>WeiDU compiler is updated to version 243.</li>
				<li>The mod has been updated to be fully compatible with BG2:EE v2.3. However, it no longer supports older versions of BG2:EE and vanilla BG2:ToB.</li>
				<li>A new drudic spell, Alicorn Lance, is ported to the game from IWD:EE.</li>
				<li>The amount of experience gained by Imoen when she re-joins the party in Spellhold is now tuned to be more in accordance with the party's current amount of XP.</li>
				<li>XP per level progression for bards, mages and sorcerers is now tweaked to progress at a slightly faster pace when the character reaches higher levels and begins gaining high level abilities.</li>
				<li>An optional component to identify all items has been introduced.</li>
				<li>Reduction of racial bonuses to saving throws for small folk has been adjusted. Instead of a simple nerf, bonuses start out small, but increase with character's level. While they are still not as powerful as they used to be, players now should have more incentive to take small folk characters into their parties.</li>
				<li>Numerous bugs and small improvements discovered during playtesting of IA v6.2 are introduced.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Version 6.2</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>WeiDU compiler is updated to version 239.</li>
                <li>A translation package for Chinese language is added.</li>
                <li>Mod's structure is modernized and improved: this is the first of many steps aimed towards more flexible and modular composition.</li>
                <li>A brand-new readme designed from scratch in place of the old collection of text documents.</li>
                <li>An optional component that prevents NPCs from leaving due to low reputation is introduced.</li>
                <li>More bugfixes and tweaks introduced, both for vanilla game and BG2EE.</li>
                <li>Many Bioware NPCs (Jaheira, Minsc, Korgan, Jan, Mazzy, Edwin, Aerie) are tweaked to become more attractive as choices for party members.</li>
                <li>Major content changes and additions:

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Major item-related changes and additions:

                        <li>a couple of items moved to the new static locations, as well;</li>

                        <li>efforts are made, both through item upgrades and item placement, to make scimitars, katanas and spears more attractive weapon choices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Version 6.1</h5>

            <ol>

                <li>Readme edited.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Version 1</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>Initial release of the mod.</li>
