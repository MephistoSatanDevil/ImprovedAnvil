            <h4>What does this mod do?</h4>

            <p><a href="http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showforum=99" target="_blank">Improved Anvil EE</a> is a mod for BG2 and TOB. It requires Throne of Bhaal or BG2: Enhanced Edition.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><a href="adventures.html">Tactical challenges</a> and improved enemies.</li>
                <li>Many new quests and encounters.</li>
                <li>New types of monsters.</li>
                <li><a href="fixes.html">Fixes and tweaks</a>: Improved Anvil applies numerous corrections and changes (including fixes and tweaks) to the original game.</li>
                <li>Item Randomizer program: a concept introduced by Improved Anvil many years ago. A good number of powerful items has been removed from their original locations. Each time you start a new game with Improved Anvil, those items will be randomly (and sensibly) redistributed into new and difficult locations and/or in the inventory of improved and tough enemies. In other words, each time you play the game with this mod, each of those items may be in different places and you won't be sure where to look for them.</li>
                <li><a href="items.html">New item upgrades</a>: Cromwell, Maheer and Cespenar have 100+ new item upgrade recipes. Many of them require brand new components that are also added by the mod. All new items are balanced and appropriate for the level of difficulty you will encounter in the mod.</li>
                <li><a href="kits.html">Five new kits</a>: two new ranger kits, a new druid kit and a two new fighter kits are added to the game. All new kits are available to the protagonist at character creation stage. In addition, the new druid kit is assigned to Cernd, one of the new ranger kits is assigned to Valygar and one of the fighter kits is assigned to Mazzy Fentan.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All those experienced players who are tired of playing the same game over and over can now play BG2 as if they are playing an entirely new game.</p>


            <h4>Warnings and important notes</h4>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 1</span>: Improved Anvil is "the mod for the experienced players" who are looking for a challenge. It includes some really difficult battles. If you do not have the required level of tactical knowledge, you will need to have patience, draw a learning curve for yourself and improve your skills gradually while playing. If you don't have the time or the patience for that, you may need to postpone playing this mod to a later time.</p>

            <p>If spending an hour or two figuring out how to defeat a particularly strong enemy is not your idea of fun, and you'd rather enjoy good story, dialogues and other RP aspects, I suggest that you skip playing the mod altogether. You'll most certainly be frustrated and what would be the point in that?</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 2</span>: We recommend that you don't cheat during the game if you intend to play Improved Anvil. Cheating may look harmless at the first glance and may even help you win some battles, but many global variables are checking the events during the game and cheating sometimes may mess up the future events. Cheating is not confined to using console commands or using external programs. Any action which is deliberately performed to exploit the game's engine is a cheat. Any action which a DM would not allow you to perform in a PnP is a cheat as well.</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 3</span>: It is strongly recommended to play Improved Anvil with as many party members as possible. Improved Anvil is not designed for solo characters or even for parties with fewer than five members. Create a custom party via a multiplayer session or take your time to choose and collect your desired NPCs normally (no need to hurry) in the game, but don't go too far with a party of fewer than 5 members. A full party of 6 members is strongly recommended even over a party of 5 members.</p>

            <p>You might still win the game with a solo character or a smaller party, but expect surprises and don't complain about the game being mean to you or certain encounters being too easy/too tough. All of IA's tactical content is balanced for a full, well-rounded 6 person party. We will never make any effort to adapt them to any other situations. You're on your own.</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 4</span>: If you are a completely new player and appear to be at loss regarding what to do, why the mod is built this way and how to approach it, please refer to our <a href="new_player.html">guide</a> for the new players. And don't hesitate to ask a question at our <a href="http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showforum=99" target="_blank">forum</a>!</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 5</span>: Improved Anvil does not play well with other mods. It's a total conversion kind of mod and does too many changes to be realistically compatible. At a certain point in the past, a decision was made to make IA as stable and bug-free as possible. The trade-off was compatibility.</p>

            <p>Some mods are incompatible for conceptual reasons. We have our spells and items, our own randomizer, our own AI, our own HLA tables, etc. So there is no point whatsoever to try and install Spell Revisions, Item Revisions, SCS, Item Randomizer or any other mods that are great by themselves. It would lead to bugs, pain and suffering. IA is a all-or-nothing kind of thing.</p>

            <p>From the point of engineering, IA is outdated. It does many changes the old way, by overwriting existing resources with its own new versions instead of applying direct patches. Until this is resolved (the huge overhaul is planned for the next major version), IA would really just screw over any changes a previously installed mod might have made and vice-versa.</p>

            <p>Smaller mods such as custom chars have a chance to work but they might introduce bugs that will affect both their own content and IA's. If you have bugs due to another mod installed, I will try to help, but to a limited extent. I will, however, work with any modder who wants to make his mod specifically compatible with IA in spirit of cooperation and common desire to improve our favourite game.</p>
