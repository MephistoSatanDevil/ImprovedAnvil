            <h4>What does this mod do?</h4>

            <p><a href="http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showforum=99" target="_blank">Improved Anvil EE</a> is a mod for BG2 and TOB. It requires Throne of Bhaal or BG2: Enhanced Edition.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><a href="adventures.html">Tactical challenges</a> and improved enemies.</li>
                <li>Many new quests and encounters.</li>
                <li>New types of monsters.</li>
                <li><a href="fixes.html">Fixes and tweaks</a>: Improved Anvil applies numerous corrections and changes (including fixes and tweaks) to the original game.</li>
                <li>Item Randomizer program: a novelty introduced by Improved Anvil. A good number of powerful items have been removed from their original locations. Each time you start a new game with Improved Anvil, those items will be randomly (and sensibly) redistributed into new and difficult locations and/or in the inventory of improved and tough enemies. In other words, each time you play the game with this mod, each of those items may be in different places and you won't be sure where to look for them.</li>
                <li><a href="items.html">New item upgrades</a>: Cromwell, Maheer and Cespenar have 100+ new item upgrade recipes most of which require brand new components which are also added to the game by this mod.</li>
                <li><a href="kits.html">Four new kits</a>: two new ranger kits, a new druid kit and a new fighter kit are added to the game. All new kits are available to the protagonist at character creation stage. In addition, the new druid kit is assigned to Cernd and one of the new ranger kits is assigned to Valygar as well.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All those experienced players who are tired of playing the same game over and over can now play BG2 as if they are playing an entirely new game.</p>


            <h4>Warnings and important notes</h4>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 1</span>: Improved Anvil is "the mod for the experienced players". It includes some really difficult battles. If you do not have the required level of tactical knowledge, you will need to have patience and draw a learning curve for yourself and improve your skills gradually while playing the mod. If you don't have the time or the patience for that, you may need to postpone playing this mod to a later time.</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 2</span>: Never cheat during the game if you intend to play Improved Anvil. Cheating may look harmless at the first glance and may even help you win some battles, but many global variables are checking the events during the game and cheating may mess up the future events. Cheating is not confined to using console commands or using external programs. Any action which is deliberately performed to exploit the game's engine is a cheat. Any action which a DM would not allow you to perform in a PnP is a cheat as well.</p>

            <p><span class="lite1">Note 3</span>: It is strongly recommended to play Improved Anvil with as many party members as possible. Improved Anvil is not designed for solo characters or even for parties with fewer than five members. Take your time to choose and collect your desired NPCs normally (no need to hurry) in the game, but don't go too far into the game with a party of fewer than 5 members. A full party of 6 members is strongly recommended even over a party of 5 members.</p>
            </ol>
