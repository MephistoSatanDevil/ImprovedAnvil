            <h4>The Four</h4>

            <p>The idea of making this mod started with a number requests for an item mod in Sorcerer's Place
forum. It was Sikret's gift to all members of Sorcerer's Place. This mod adds four items to the game, each of which is guarded by a group of guardians.</p>
            
            <h4>Description of the four items</h4>

It is said that this last request was fulfilled and Zafir killed a good number of kobolds before his heroic death. His fury transferred into his ring when he died.</li>
