@4765 = ~Enough! I guess I should kill you myself, especially since it seems that you are not alone here and some divine or arcane sources are interfering.~
@4766 = ~This is the real battle.~
@4767 = ~This is illogical! A mortal is about to defeat a force.~
@4768 = ~I have to leave this avatar as well; and since I have no other avatar at hand, I will have to fragmentize and spread myself in the universe.~
@4769 = ~This means I won't be able to capture an avatar for a millennium.~
@4770 = ~Celebrate your victory, mortal! But be aware that you defeated me only because I had lost most of my energy in battles with other forces during the last millennium. If I wasn't weakened, I wouldn't have even needed your damned sphere to leave this plane.~
