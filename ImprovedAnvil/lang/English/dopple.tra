@2250 = ~What the hell are you doing here? I thought that once that Roshan is captured, this area would be safe for hiding.~
@2251 = ~Bah! Why Auriel or myself just never guessed that a doppleganger could have taken Roshan's appearance?~
@2252 = ~I am here to put an end to your life murderer. But I may reconsider if you come with me and tell the whole story to the authorities.~
@2253 = ~Because you are a bunch of fools. Prepare to die! You will not live long enough to tell your story to anyone.~
@2254 = ~Do your worst, <PRO_RACE>! You will not survive this battle to tell your story to anyone.~
