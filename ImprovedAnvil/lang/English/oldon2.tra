@4280 = ~<CHARNAME> is not my apprentice. <PRO_HESHE> is a brilliant mage who has come with me voluntarily.~
@4281 = ~On the contrary, <PRO_HESHE> knows everything about you and <PRO_HESHE> is speaking the truth.~
@4282 = ~You, maniacs, ruined the lives of many smart mages for your mad and evil goals during the last four centuries. Now, it is the time for us to put an end to this long tragedy. All three of you will be killed on this day.~
@4283 = ~Well, it's over. Grave Liches are destroyed. I thank you for your help, <CHARNAME>!~
@4284 = ~My apprentice must be somewhere in this place. Now that the enemies are all killed he should be free and will come to find you soon. His name is 'Morid'.~
@4285 = ~I have told him that once this issue is over, he should stay with you. He will prove to be a very helpful assistant apprentice for you in your stronghold.~
@4286 = ~I have trained him well and he has some very particular skills.~
@4287 = ~What are you planning to do yourself?~
@4288 = ~I'm really tired. I will return to rearrange my laboratory and will probably spend the rest of my life training young mages and researching new spells and items.~
@4289 = ~Before I forget, please accept this cloak as a thanksgiving and memento. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
