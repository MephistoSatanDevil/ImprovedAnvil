@1550 = ~Well, I see that you two mortal beings were smart enough to spoil my plan.~
@1551 = ~I'm sure you are curious to know the whole story. It was all a game, or rather a bet which I had made with another deity.~
@1552 = ~I had bet that I could decive two powerful and intelligent mortals to follow my prophecies and eventually fight against each other. Now, I have lost the bet.~
@1553 = ~Since it was all a game, I won't be too hard on you for costing me the bet. However, I do think that you deserve some form of punishment from me, since you did rather annoy me by making me lose.~
@1554 = ~It's still a game for me, which means that if you survive this final battle, I will let you go without any further punishment.~
@1555 = ~It will be most entertaining for me to watch your battle with a few powerful creatures. As I said, you will be free to go if you survive. Farewell, smart mortals!~
