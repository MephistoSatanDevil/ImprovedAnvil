@5000 = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@5001 = ~Lord Wetlander! I would never have imagined that we might meet again. How is it that you are not yet resting in peace?~
@5002 = ~I'm very pleased to see you again, Lord Wetlander! As you can see, I now face an even more dangerous enemy than the Master of Mirrors.~
@5003 = ~You helped me and my people when we needed you, a debt we can never truly repay. I could not yet rest in peace when a true friend now desperately needs our aid in return.~
@5004 = ~Much as I would wish it, I don't have a corporeal body to stand and fight at your side. Even so, I have come here to aid you with my power one last time. I have called upon a powerful group of the eldest of swanmays to help you in this battle. <CHARNAME>, all swanmays know what you have done for their kind and these Elders are willing to sacrifice their lives to aid your cause. In this they shall in a small way try to repay our debt to you.~
@5005 = ~I have said this before, but please allow me to say again that you are one of the greatest heroes that history has ever seen. You are the pride of the Elven nation and the noblest ranger that has ever lived in the realms. I am deeply honored to have had the chance to know you.~
@5006 = ~The honor has been mine <LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>! Now that I have done all that I can to aid you, I can truly rest in peace. Farewell, my friend!~
